# Log monitor

This assignment focuses on monitoring logs. It scans the log file and returns a report with errors in sessions along with the last three messages before the error, assuming the session ends when an error occurs.

## Usage

To run the script, make sure you include necessary log files within the path
```python
python3 main.py
```
it generates a log file named output.log

A unit test script is also included. To run the unit test, make sure input, output, log handler are in the same path

```python
python3 unit_test_logHandler.py
```
